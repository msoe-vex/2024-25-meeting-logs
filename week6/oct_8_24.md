### Engineering Notebook Entry

**Date:** October 8, 2024  
**Project:** Robotics - Path Planning, Robot Communication, Task Abstraction, and Web Dashboard  

---

#### **Leblib Path Planning**
**Group:** Andrew, Peter, Salvin  
**Objective:** Set up the Leblib path planning library and begin integrating it with autonomous navigation and odometry.  

- **Plan:** 
  - Successfully set up the path planning library (Leblib) on our development environment.
  - Initial testing was not conducted yet; plan to test integration with the robot's autonomous systems and odometry tomorrow.
  
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Tomorrow, we will try running the library with our robot's autonomous functionalities and odometry data.
  - Identify if any adjustments or customizations are needed for better integration.

#### **Robot Communication**
**Group:** Luke, Leigh, Miles  
**Objective:** Establish a communication protocol between robots and test message reception.  

- **Plan:**
  - Set up a basic test environment to verify correct message reception between robots.
  - Began discussing the communication protocol for inter-robot messaging, focusing on what specific data needs to be shared.

- **Key Considerations for Communication Protocol:**  
  - **Location data:** Essential for coordinating movements between robots.  
  - **Object detection data:** Could be useful in determining shared understanding of obstacles or objectives.  
  - **Game state:** Related to object detection, the state of the game (such as target detection or task progress) may need to be shared.  
  - **Help signal:** To allow one robot to request assistance from another if necessary.

- **Next Steps:**  
  - Finalize the communication protocol, specifying the exact data types to be transmitted.
  - Implement and test the protocol between the robots.

#### **Task Abstraction**
**Group:** Not assigned yet  
**Objective:** Develop a task management system for handling asynchronous tasks during autonomous robot operation.

- **Plan:**
  - The idea is to create a system that abstracts robot actions and allows for asynchronous task management.
  - Two potential approaches were considered: either developing our own task system or using the existing task management system in the PROS library.
  
- **Next Steps:**
  - Research both options: creating a custom task system vs. leveraging PROS.
  - Determine how events can be triggered within the system to better manage robot actions.

#### **Web Dashboard**
**Status:** Paused / Peripheral  
**Objective:** Update and integrate the internal path planning interface to export JSON data.

- **Plan:**
  - The web dashboard interface, developed a few years ago, needs updates to ensure compatibility with our current system.
  - Initial review of legacy code has not yet been conducted.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Review the legacy code to assess the current implementation.
  - Ensure the dashboard can export JSON data for use in other areas of the project.

#### **Website Maintenance**
**Group:** Salvin, Andy  
**Objective:** Modernize the website and update the content.  

- **Plan:**
  - The website is outdated and has dependency issues with npm, preventing updates in its current state.
  - Initial steps will involve resolving these dependency issues to make the site functional in modern environments.
  
- **Content Updates Considered:**
  - Sponsor list.
  - Links to relevant GitHub repositories (pneumatic reverse engineering, senior design projects, web dashboard, website).
  - Past engineering notebooks, Onshape designs (past robots), and updated tournament statistics.
  - Contact information update.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Fix the dependency issues.
  - Begin content updates as discussed, starting with sponsor lists and repository links.
