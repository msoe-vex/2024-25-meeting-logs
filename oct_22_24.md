Meeting Notes:

- VEXlink Docs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13mTA6BT7CPskJzh4YgsfAfoH9OgK75Hn/view?pli=1
  - Found that issue with VEXlink might be due to the order of the controller and the VEXlink device ports.
  - Excerpts:
    - When multiple radios are connected to a V5 brain, the radio in the highest numbered smart port will be used for the controller VEXnet connection, to avoid errors
