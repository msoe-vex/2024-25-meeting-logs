\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a reinforcement learning environment for the VEX robot
    \item Train the robot to use an optimal strategy to score as many points as possible
    \item Update the structure of the environment to better represent the robot and field
    \item Optimize the environment and training process to improve the robot's performance
    \item Integrate the CasADi program to plan optimal paths between positions for each action
    \item Add options to change hyperparameters and environment settings to optimize training
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Gymnasium and Stable Baselines3 to create the environment and train the robot
    \item Use Slurm to run the training script on the cluster to train quickly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added arguments to change hyperparameters and environment settings to allow for more flexibility in training
    \item Integrated the CasADi program to plan optimal paths between positions for each action and to calculate realistic estimates for the paths
    \item Training now takes significantly longer but uses more accurate time costs for paths, this can be turned off to speed up training
    \item Updated code to GitHub repo: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add different colors for rings
    \item Update the environment depending on the match type (skills or regular match)
    \item Export functions for the VEX program based on actions that take place to create autonomous programs
    \item Test the VEX program to ensure paths generated by a list of points work as expected
\end{itemize}
