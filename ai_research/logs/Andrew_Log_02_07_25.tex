\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a reinforcement learning environment for the VEX robot
    \item Train the robot to use an optimal strategy to score as many points as possible
    \item Update the structure of the environment to better represent the robot and field
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Gymnasium and Stable Baselines3 to create the environment and train the robot
    \item Use Slurm to run the training script on the cluster to train quickly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to create a basic environment with several actions and render each step
    \item Updated the reward system to use the score of the field instead of arbitrary rewards assigned to each action based on results
    \item The reward = score after action - score before action
    \item After training for 500,000 steps, the robot was able to score about 24 points in 120 seconds
    \item Updated code to GitHub repo: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the structure of the environment to better represent the robot and field
    \item Add different colors for rings
    \item Add wall stakes
    \item Add probability of actions succeeding
    \item Update the environment to account for unknown and missing information about elements on the field
\end{itemize}
