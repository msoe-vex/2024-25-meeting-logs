\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/26/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refactor the test program to properly constrain the position, velocity, and acceleration of the robot
    \item Update the solver to avoid the middle of the field
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the CasADi documentation to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed
    \item Review the existing code to determine what needs to be changed and what can be removed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The new solver now used proper constraints without redundancy
    \item The Numpy graph was updated to show a simplified view of the field and path
    \item GitHub repo for CasADi test program: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}
    \item GitHub repo for another users implementation: \href{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Need to figure out how to make the robot avoid the middle of the field without hard constraining it
    \item Need to make sure the LemLib max speed parameter is being used correctly so that the path run properly
    \item Add an option to change the number of points and time step dynamically
    \item Will work on updating the cost function to minimize the amount of time
    \item After that, will work on converting the Python program to a C++ implementation
\end{itemize}
