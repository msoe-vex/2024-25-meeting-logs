\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/19/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the python test path program to use diamond shaped obstacle instead of circles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the CasADi documentation to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed
    \item Utilize ChatGPT to quickly develop the program
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The diamond shape programs led the solver to run into an issue where there are too few degrees of freedom
    \item GitHub repo for CasADi test program: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}
    \item GitHub repo for another users implementation: \href{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Need to figure out how to implement diamond shaped obstacles, or regular polygons in general
    \item May need to use circles to approximate location of obstacles
    \item Will update the program to change the units to inches so that it can be used with LemLib
    \item Will research how LemLib controls the robot based on a list of points, and look into exporting in that format
    \item After that, will work on converting the Python program to a C++ implementation
\end{itemize}
