\section{CasADi Test Program}
\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/08/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the python test path program to minimize the amount of time to traveled instead of just the path length
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use ChatGPT to generate a basic test program and iterate from there to fit our use case
    \item Use the CasADi documentation to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed
    \item Find other existing programs to build off of
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to get a solver working that minimizes the amount of time
    \item The solver also has constraints for maximum velocity and acceleration
    \item The robot starts and ends at a complete stop
    \item The program is very finicky  at the moment, any small change in the constraints or staring values can cause the solver to not be able to find a solution
    \item GitHub repo for CasADi test program: \href{https://github.com/satsinush/CasADi-Test.git}{https://github.com/satsinush/CasADi-Test.git}
    \item GitHub repo for another users implementation: \href{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will use the tianchenji/path-planning.git repo to learn how to better implement CasADi
    \item After that, will work on converting the Python program to a C++ implementation
\end{itemize}
