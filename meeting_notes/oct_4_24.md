Controls Group Accomplishments [9/30/24; Monday]  

    Landon & Hunter 

    Odometry pods are working and calculations appear to be accurate. More precise offset measurements will be needed to improve accuracy.  

    Square root input curve on drive is working using voltage control 

    Voltage control allows motors to drive above max speed 

    Due to uneven friction, voltage control adds slight drift and may need to be removed 

 

To-Dos for next meeting [10/2/24; Wednesday]
