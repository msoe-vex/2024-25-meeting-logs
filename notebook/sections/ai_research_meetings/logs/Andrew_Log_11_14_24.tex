\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a LemLib PROS project to control the robot in auton and opcontrol
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new PROS project
    \item Install LemLib depot
    \item Update the program to control the robot in auton and opcontrol
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to get a program working that calculates the position of the robot based of the inputs of tracking wheel encoders
    \item Added classes to allow selection of auton during the initialize part of the match
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confirm that the auton selector works in a match
    \item Create a split arcade drive configuration to control the robot in opcontrol
    \item Tune PID constants and make sure the chassis configuration is correct and tracks robot position correctly
\end{itemize}
