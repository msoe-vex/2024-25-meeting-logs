\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/20/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create an autonomous selector GUI to select an autonomous program to run from a list of options
    \item Use Jerry.io to plan paths for LemLib pure pursuit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use PROS buttons to switch between auton programs
    \item Add autonomous paths to the static folder to compile to the program
    \item Uploaded a test program to test LemLib pure pursuit
    \item Multiplied the tracking wheel diameter to account for the more precise encoders
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added custom functions to create and select autons before the match starts
    \item Used static folder to create ASSETS that will be saved at compile time to save autons before to the program
    \item The robot followed the path correctly 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize    \item Create a split arcade drive configuration to control the robot in opcontrol
    \item Tune PID constants and make sure the chassis configuration is correct and tracks robot position correctly
\end{itemize}
