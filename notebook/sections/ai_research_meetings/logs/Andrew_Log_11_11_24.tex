\section{CasADi Test Program}
\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/11/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the python test path program to follow the laws of physics and come to a complete stop at start and end points
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iterate the path planning repo to fit our use case
    \item Use the CasADi documentation to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed
    \item Utilize ChatGPT to quickly develop the program
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to get a solver working that follows a smooth path and limits the maximum speed and velocity
    \item The solver works in about 0.1 seconds so it will be able to calculate paths in real time during the match
    \item Currently the program has a static time interval and a variable amount of steps to look into
    \item GitHub repo for CasADi test program: \href{https://github.com/satsinush/CasADi-Test.git}{https://github.com/satsinush/CasADi-Test.git}
    \item GitHub repo for another users implementation: \href{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}{https://github.com/tianchenji/path-planning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will update the program to change the units to inches so that it can be used with LemLib
    \item Will research how LemLib controls the robot based on a list of points
    \item The program can be updated to use a set number of steps and a variable amount of time in between them
    \item After that, will work on converting the Python program to a C++ implementation
\end{itemize}
