\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve efficiency and performance of our path planning algorithm for our simulation
    \item Integrate the path planning algorithm with the VEX robot simulation environment control program
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement A* algorithm to find optimal initial path to optimize
    \item Export path as a flattened list of points to be used in the VEX program
    \item Include total distance for better estimate of duration of the path
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The A* algorithm worked effectively to find an initial path for the robot to follow
    \item The new inital path generation only adds about 0.1 seconds to processing time, which is a sufficiently small amount to not affect path genration in competition
    \item Generating paths in training slows down training significantly, but this can be turned off to speed up training
    \item The initial path generated by A* reduced the number of failed paths by about 20\% in the training environment
    \item The path was successfully exported as a flattened list of points, which can be used in the VEX program
    \item Running the path is not completely accuratue due to PID not being tuned for the new path generation, but it is a good starting point
    \item Updated code to GitHub repo: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fix the PID controller to work with the new path generation
    \item Ensure the path is being followed correctly in the VEX program and accounting for robot's size
\end{itemize}
