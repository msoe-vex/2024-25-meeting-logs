\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize multi agent simulation to train multiple robots to work together
    \item Build off of the existing simulation environment to allow for multiple robots to be trained at once
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use PettingZoo library to create a multi-agent environment
    \item Use RlLib from Ray to train the agents in the multi-agent environment
    \item Test the multi-agent environment with multiple robots to ensure they can work together effectively
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The new environment was successfully created using the PettingZoo library
    \item Actions are sent to the model in an synchonized format, and each action is performed in chronological order
    \item After each action, the "robot time" is updated to reflect the time taken for the action to be performed
    \item Only the robot with the lowest "robot time" is allowed to take an action, which prevents multiple robots from taking actions at the same time
    \item The multi-agent environment was successfully tested with multiple robots, and they were able to work together effectively
    \item The agents can learn from randomized environment states to learn generalized game strategies
    \item The agents don't currently have information about the other agents, so they must learn to work together without communication
    \item Updated code to GitHub repo: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create script to compile the policy into a compact inferencing model that can be used in the VEX program
    \item Integrate the compiled model with communication between the VEX program and the Jetson Nano running the model
    \item Test running the model on the Jetson Nano to ensure it can run in real-time
\end{itemize}
