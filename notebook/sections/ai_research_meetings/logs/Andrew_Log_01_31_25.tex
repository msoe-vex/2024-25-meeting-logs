\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a reinforcement learning environment for the VEX robot
    \item Train the robot to use an optimal strategy to score as many points as possible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Gymnasium and Stable Baselines3 to create the environment and train the robot
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to create a basic environment with several actions and render each step
    \item Added code to GitHub repo: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/VEX-AI-Reinforcement-Learning.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add restrictions for actions
    \item Add more actions
    \item Update rewards for each action
    \item Train the model to score as many points as possible in as little time as possible
    \item Update the structure of the environment to better represent the robot and field
\end{itemize}
