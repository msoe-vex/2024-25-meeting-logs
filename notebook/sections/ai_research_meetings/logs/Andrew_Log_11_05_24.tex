\section{CasADi Test Program}
\timestamp{Andrew Needham}{[11/05/24]}{}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a basic Python program to get familiar with using the CasADi library to generate robot path trajectories
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use ChatGPT to generate a basic test program and iterate from there to fit our use case
    \item Use the CasADi documentation to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was able to get a basic program that minimizes the distance traveled between two points given a list of obstacles to avoid
    \item The program optimizes the objective function given a set of constraints and plots the path on a graph
    \item GitHub repo for CasADi test program: \href{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}{https://github.com/msoe-vex/CasADi-Test.git}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will update the program to minimize the amount of time used to travel from one point to another
    \item After that, will work on converting the Python program to a C++ implementation
\end{itemize}
