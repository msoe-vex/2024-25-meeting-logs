\section{Monday Controls Group Meeting}
\timestamp{Landon \& Hunter}{[9/30/24]}{}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Odometry pods are working and calculations appear to be accurate. More precise offset measurements will be needed to improve accuracy.
    \item Square root input curve on drive is working using voltage control.
    \item Voltage control allows motors to drive above max speed.
    \item Due to uneven friction, voltage control adds slight drift and may need to be removed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SD card for differentiation between bots, images, odometer.
    \item Implementing path gen for usable auton paths in competition.
\end{itemize}
