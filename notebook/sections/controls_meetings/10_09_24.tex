\subsection{Meeting Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a simple program for exploring VEXlink communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
Using the VEXlink communication protocol, we can send signals to the robot. However, we are unable to send signals when the remotes are connected. We wrote some basic tests to try to get the remotes connected.

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wrote a simple program to test VEXlink communication
    \item We can send signals, but not with remotes connected
    \item Wrote some basic tests to try to get to connected
\end{itemize}
